# NRL Scores

This is a real simple app that crawls the [NRL draw](https://www.nrl.com/draw/ "NRL DRAW") page, and prints out a few basic console tables containing either previous scores from that round, live game scores, or upcoming game times.

This app uses Node.js and Puppeteer to crawl the DOM.

Run `node index.js` to get the results printed to the console.
